### About me
  Hi, I am Dennis. I am a F4 student from Macau. I am interested in Engineering, Programming, and Robotics! I love designing and creating robots from scratch. When I first discovered Engineering and Robotics, I realized I’d found the crossroads of everything I was interested in: Design, Physics, and Computer programming. Since then, I have started to create robots in the work-flow of design, prototyping, and testing.
  Until now, I had worked on 4 projects, which included robotics engineering, computer programming, software engineering and electrical engineering.

  Engineering attracts me in that it’s everywhere in our lives, from the transistors of our phone's chip to the camera in the Mars Curiosity Rover.
I think robotics is the practical application of mathematics, physics, electronics, and design. Robotics brings those complicated theories and physics statement alive and makes them to become closer to our live.
